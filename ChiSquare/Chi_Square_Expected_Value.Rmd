### Chi-Square: Expected Values

- **Calculation**: The expected value for each cell is given by:
  \[
  \text{Expected Value} = \frac{\text{Row Total} \times \text{Column Total}}{\text{Overall Total}}
  \]

The test statistic is then compared to a critical value to determine if the null hypothesis can be rejected.

### Chi-Square: Expected Values

- **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value for cell \((i,j)\) is computed as:
  \[
  \text{Expected Value} = \frac{\text{Row Total} \times \text{Column Total}}{\text{Overall Total}}
  \]

The final hypothesis test involves comparing the calculated chi-square statistic to the critical value from the chi-square distribution to determine if the null hypothesis can be rejected.

### Expected Values and Chi-Square Statistic

- **Expected Value Formula**:
  \[
  \text{Expected Value} = \frac{\text{Row Total} \times \text{Column Total}}{\text{Overall Total}}
  \]
- **Chi-Square Test Statistic**:
  \[
  \chi^2_{TS} = \sum \frac{(n_i - e_i)^2}{e_i}
  \]
