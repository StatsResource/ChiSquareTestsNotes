### Section: Chi-Square Test for Association using SPSS Statistics

#### Introduction
The chi-square test for independence (Pearson's chi-square test) is used to determine if there is a relationship between two categorical variables.

#### Assumptions
To use a chi-square test for independence, data must meet two assumptions:
1. **Variable Measurement**: Variables should be measured at an ordinal or nominal level (categorical data).
2. **Categorical Independent Groups**: Variables should consist of two or more independent groups. Examples include gender, ethnicity, activity level, profession, etc.

#### SPSS Example
An educator wants to know if gender (male/female) is associated with the preferred type of learning medium (online/books). Thus, we have two nominal variables: Gender and Preferred Learning Medium.

- **Setup in SPSS Statistics**: Create variables for Gender and Preferred\_Learning\_Medium.
- **Test Procedure in SPSS Statistics**: Follow these steps to analyze your data using the chi-square test for independence:
  1. Click Analyze > Descriptive Statistics > Crosstabs.
  2. Transfer the variables into the Row(s) and Column(s) boxes.
  3. To display clustered bar charts, check the Display clustered bar charts checkbox.

#### Steps for Chi-Square Test in SPSS Statistics:
1. Click Analyze > Descriptive Statistics > Crosstabs.
2. Transfer Gender to Row(s) box and Preferred\_Learning\_Medium to Column(s) box.
3. Check Display clustered bar charts.
4. Click Statistics button, select Chi-square and Phi and Cramer's V.
5. Click Continue.
6. Click Cells button, select Observed from Counts area, and Row, Column, and Total from Percentages area.
7. Click Continue.
8. Optionally, adjust the order of values.
9. Click Continue.
10. Generate output.

- **Output**: Check the Crosstabulation Table and Chi-Square Tests Table. Look for the Pearson Chi-Square row to see if there is a significant association between variables.

### Section: Chi-Square Test for Association using SPSS Statistics

#### Introduction
The chi-square test for independence, also known as Pearson's chi-square test or the chi-square test of association, is used to determine if there is a relationship between two categorical variables.

#### Assumptions
To use a chi-square test for independence, your data must meet two key assumptions:

1. **Measurement Level**: Both variables should be measured at an ordinal or nominal level (categorical data).
2. **Categorical Independent Groups**: Each variable should consist of two or more categorical, independent groups. Examples include gender (male/female), ethnicity (Caucasian, African American, Hispanic), physical activity level (sedentary, low, moderate, high), and profession (surgeon, doctor, nurse, dentist, therapist).

In the Procedure section, we'll illustrate how to perform a chi-square test for independence using SPSS Statistics with an example.

#### SPSS Example
Consider an educator who wants to determine if there is a relationship between gender (male/female) and the preferred learning medium (online/books). Hence, we have two nominal variables: Gender and Preferred Learning Medium.

##### Setup in SPSS Statistics
Create two variables in SPSS Statistics: Gender and Preferred\_Learning\_Medium. Our enhanced guide provides detailed steps on entering data into SPSS Statistics for running a chi-square test for independence.

##### Test Procedure in SPSS Statistics
Follow these steps to analyze your data using a chi-square test for independence in SPSS Statistics. At the end of these steps, you'll learn how to interpret the results:

1. **Click Analyze > Descriptive Statistics > Crosstabs**
2. **Transfer Variables**: Transfer Gender to the Row(s) box and Preferred\_Learning\_Medium to the Column(s) box. Use the mouse to highlight and transfer or drag-and-drop the variables.
3. **Display Bar Charts**: Check the Display clustered bar charts checkbox (recommended).
4. **Open Crosstabs: Statistics Dialog Box**: Click the Statistics button, select Chi-square and Phi and Cramer's V.
5. **Continue to Next Steps**: Click Continue, then click the Cells button.
6. **Select Counts and Percentages**: In the Cells dialog box, select Observed from the Counts area, and Row, Column, and Total from the Percentages area.
7. **Further Format Options**: Optionally, click the Format button to change the order of values to either ascending or descending (useful if there are more than two categories).
8. **Generate Output**: Click Continue and then the Generate button to create your output.

##### Output Interpretation
You'll see several tables in the Output Viewer under "Crosstabs":

- **Crosstabulation Table**: Displays the distribution of males and females across the preferred learning mediums.
- **Chi-Square Tests Table**: Check the "Pearson Chi-Square" row for statistical significance. For example, \(\chi^2(1) = 0.487\), \(p = 0.485\) indicates no significant association between gender and preferred learning medium.
- **Symmetric Measures Table**: Phi and Cramer's V provide the strength of association between variables.
- **Bar Chart**: Visual representation of the frequency distribution, making it easier to understand the data.
