### Chi-Square Test for Independence

#### Hypotheses
- **Null Hypothesis (H$_0$)**: Hair color and eye color are independent.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H$_1$)**: Hair and eye color are dependent.

#### Row and Column Sums
- The number of people with blue eyes is the sum of the first row (150).
- The number of people with brown eyes is the sum of the second row (150).
- The total number of individuals is 300.

#### Expected Number of Observations
If traits are independent, the probability of having a given hair and eye color is the product of the individual probabilities.

\[ \text{P(blond hair, blue eyes)} = \text{P(blond hair)} \times \text{P(blue eyes)} \]

The expected number of observations for each cell under the null hypothesis is calculated as:

\[ e_{i,j} = \frac{n_{i,\cdot} \cdot n_{\cdot,j}}{n} \]

This is the row sum times the column sum divided by the total number of observations.

#### Test Statistic
The test statistic is calculated as:

\[ T = \sum_{i,j} \frac{(n_{i,j} - e_{i,j})^2}{e_{i,j}} \]

- The realization of this statistic, \( t \), measures the distance of observations from expectations under H$_0$.
- If H$_0$ is true, \( n_{i,j} \) and \( e_{i,j} \) should be similar, making \( t \) close to 0. Large values of \( t \) suggest dependence.

### Chi Square Test For Independence

#### Distribution of the Test Statistic Under \( H_0 \)

- **Approximate Distribution**: If the traits are independent, the test statistic has an approximate chi-squared distribution with \((r - 1) \times (c - 1)\) degrees of freedom. Here, \(r\) and \(c\) represent the number of rows and columns respectively in the contingency table.
- **Approximation Validity**: This approximation holds well if there are at least 5 observations expected in each cell under the null hypothesis (\( H_0 \)).

---

### Making Conclusions

- **Interpretation of \( t \)**: Large values of \( t \) suggest that the traits are dependent. To reject the null hypothesis of independence at a significance level \(\alpha\), we compare \( t \) with the critical value of the chi-squared distribution, \( \chi^2_{(r-1)(c-1), \alpha} \).
- **Critical Values Reference**: These critical values can be obtained from standard chi-squared distribution tables.

---

### Describing the Nature of an Association

- **Comparative Analysis**: To discern the nature of the association, compare observed values with expected values.
- **Observations**: For instance, if you observe more dark hair with brown eyes and blond hair with blue eyes than expected under \( H_0 \), it suggests an association between these traits.



### Distribution of the Test Statistic Under \(H_0\)

- **Test Statistic Distribution**: Given the traits are independent, the test statistic follows an approximate chi-squared distribution with \((r - 1) \times (c - 1)\) degrees of freedom, where \(r\) and \(c\) are the numbers of rows and columns, respectively.
- **Approximation Validity**: This approximation is valid if at least 5 observations are expected in each cell under \(H_0\).

### Making Conclusions

- **Significance Level**: Large values of \(t\) indicate dependence between the traits. We reject the null hypothesis of independence at a significance level \(\alpha\) if \( t > \chi^2_{(r-1)(c-1),\alpha} \), where \(\chi^2_{(r-1)(c-1),\alpha}\) is the critical value for the appropriate chi-squared distribution.
- **Critical Values**: These values can be referenced from statistical tables.

### Describing the Nature of an Association

- **Comparison**: To understand the association between hair and eye color, compare observed and expected values.
- **Observations**: For instance, if dark hair is associated with brown eyes and blond hair with blue eyes, it suggests more observations than expected under the null hypothesis.

### Expected Values and Chi-Square Statistic

- **Expected Value Formula**:
  \[
  \text{Expected Value} = \frac{\text{Row Total} \times \text{Column Total}}{\text{Overall Total}}
  \]
- **Chi-Square Test Statistic**:
  \[
  \chi^2_{TS} = \sum \frac{(n_i - e_i)^2}{e_i}
  \]
