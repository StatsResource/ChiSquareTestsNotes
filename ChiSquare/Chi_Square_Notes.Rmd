## Chapter: Chi Square Goodness of Fit Tests

### Section: Contingency Tables

In the realm of goodness of fit tests, we deal with a single categorical variable. For instance, consider the screen size of TV sets sold. Here, the hypothesis revolves around the pattern of frequencies or distribution of the variable.

- **Observed Frequencies**: These can be listed as a single row or column of categories.
- **Tests for Independence**: These involve at least two categorical variables. The hypothesis tested is that these variables are statistically independent, meaning knowledge of one variable's category does not affect the probability of the other variable's category.

When two variables are involved, we use a contingency table (or two-way classification table) to enter observed frequencies.

- **Table Dimensions**: Defined by \( r \times c \), where \( r \) indicates rows and \( c \) indicates columns.
- **Null Hypothesis**: If rejected, it indicates the two variables are dependent and related. For example, a contingency table might reveal a relationship between age and the gender of stereo shop customers.

The expected frequency for each cell of a contingency table is proportionate to the total observed frequencies in the column and row, relative to the total sample size.

- **Expected Frequency Formula**: Given \( f_r \) (total frequency in a row) and \( f_c \) (total frequency in a column), we determine the expected frequency for a cell.
- **Degrees of Freedom**: For a test of independence, it’s given by \( df = (r - 1)(c - 1) \).

### Section: Chi Square

For this test, the chi-squared test statistic is given by:

\[
X^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
\]

- **Null Hypothesis**: States that the frequency distribution observed in a sample is consistent with a particular theoretical distribution. Events must be mutually exclusive with a total probability of 1. This is common for outcomes of a categorical variable.

- **Terms**:
  - \( X^2 \): Test statistic approaching a chi-square distribution.
  - \( O_i \): Observed frequency.
  - \( E_i \): Expected frequency, based on the null hypothesis.
  - \( n \): Number of possible outcomes for each event.

The chi-square statistic can be used to calculate a p-value by comparing it to a chi-square distribution. Degrees of freedom are equal to the number of cells \( n \), minus the reduction in degrees of freedom \( p \).

Here's an example of a contingency table and its calculations:

**Expected Values (under null hypothesis)**

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
& Maths & Eq. Studies & Chemistry & Sum \\
\hline
Male & 15 & 15 & 30 & 60 \\
\hline
Female & 15 & 15 & 30 & 60 \\
\hline
Sum & 30 & 30 & 60 & 120 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

### Chi-Square Goodness of Fit

- **Scenario**: Twenty-five machine operators produce items, some of which are defective. Random samples from each operator's production show the number of defective items out of 10 sampled items.
- **Data**:
  \begin{verbatim}
  2 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
  1 1 0 0 3 0 1 2 0 0
  1 3 1 2 0
  \end{verbatim}
- **Hypothesis**: The null hypothesis is that each operator has a 10% defective production rate. We test whether the observed data provide enough evidence to reject this hypothesis.

### Contingency Tables

Contingency tables are utilized to examine the relationship between subjects' scores on two qualitative or categorical variables.

### Tests for Goodness of Fit

- Basic Counting Model
- Goodness of Fit Statistics
- Testing with Unknown Parameters
- Testing for Association in Two-Way Tables

---

### Pearson's Chi-Squared Test

- **Null Hypothesis**: There is no relationship between the two categorical variables.
- **Alternative Hypothesis**: There is a relationship between the two categorical variables.

### Observed and Expected Values

Are the differences between observed values and expected values small enough to be due to random error (i.e., null hypothesis is valid) or too large for the null hypothesis to be feasible?

### Degrees of Freedom

\[ df = (r-1)(c-1) \]

- \( r \) = number of rows
- \( c \) = number of columns

For 2 rows and 3 columns, \( r = 2 \), \( c = 3 \):

\[ df = (2-1)(3-1) = (1)(2) = 2 \]

### Pearson's Chi-Squared Test Statistic

Pearson's chi-squared test uses a measure of goodness of fit which is the sum of the squared differences between observed and expected outcome frequencies, each divided by the expectation:

\[ \chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} \]

- \( O_i \): an observed frequency (i.e., count) for bin i
- \( E_i \): an expected (theoretical) frequency for bin i, as asserted by the null hypothesis.

### Chi-Squared Test Example

A $\chi^2$ test is carried out on tabular data containing counts, e.g. the number of animals that died, the number of days of rain, the number of stocks that grew in value, etc.

Usually, there are two qualitative variables, each with a number of levels, and we want to determine if there is a relationship between the two variables, e.g. hair colour and eye colour, social status and crime rates, house price and house size, gender and left/right handedness.

The data are presented in a contingency table:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
 & right-handed & left-handed & TOTAL \\
\hline
Male & 43 & 9 & 52 \\
Female & 44 & 4 & 48 \\
TOTAL & 87 & 13 & 100 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

---

### Expected Values for Each Cell

\[ E = \frac{\text{Row Total} \times \text{Column Total}}{\text{Overall Total}} \]

### Example Calculation

Expected value for Cell (2,1):

- Row 2 Total = 400
- Column 1 Total = 150
- Overall Total = 600

\[ E_{(2,1)} = \frac{400 \times 150}{600} = 100 \]

Here’s an updated version of the contingency table with computed values:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 
 & Cat X & Cat Y & Cat Z & Total \\ \hline
Cat A & 50 & 60 & 90 & 200 \\ \hline
Cat B & 100 & 120 & 180 & 400 \\ \hline
Total & 150 & 180 & 270 & \textbf{600} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
