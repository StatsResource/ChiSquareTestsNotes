## Chi-Square Test

In the MASS R package, we can find the data set `survey`. The `Smoke` column records the students' smoking habits, while the `Exer` column records their exercise level.

```{r}
library(MASS)
head(survey)
names(survey)
```

## Levels

* These variables are factors (i.e., categorical variables).
* The allowed values in `Smoke` are: `Heavy`, `Regul` (regularly), `Occas` (occasionally), and `Never`.
* The values in `Exer` are: `Freq` (frequently), `Some`, and `None`.

## Constructing the Contingency Table

We can construct the contingency table of the two variables using the `table()` function. This table will compare the students' smoking habits across the various exercise levels.

```{r}
myTable <- table(survey$Smoke, survey$Exer)
myTable
```

The contingency table is as follows:

```
       Freq None Some 
Heavy     7    1    3 
Never    87   18   84 
Occas    12    3    4 
Regul     9    1    7
```

Small Cell Sizes - This can cause problems.

## Combining Levels for Exercise

* `Exer` levels are: `Freq` (frequently), `Some`, and `None`.
* Combine `Some` and `None` into a single "not frequently" level.
* Preserve the original data by creating a new object called `Exer2`.

## Hypothesis Testing

Test the hypothesis whether the students' smoking habit is independent of their exercise level at a 0.05 significance level.

```{r}
# Perform Chi-Square Test
chisq.test(myTable)
```

The p-value was found to be 0.4828.

## Conclusion

* The p-value 0.4828 is greater than the 0.05 significance level.
* Therefore, we do not reject the null hypothesis that the smoking habit is independent of the exercise level of the students.
